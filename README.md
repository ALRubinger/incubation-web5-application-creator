# Web5 Application Creator

A web application and backend to create new Web5 applications. This is an early prototype that's an idea
playground for now. The idea is to flesh out how quickly we can get developers of Web5 applications that
first dopamine hit - of something working right from the start and easily modified to suit their needs.

This may:
* Scaffold a starting point 
* Create new applications from an example feature set
* Take inputs from the user to customize the type of application created

If we host the service as an always-available backend, we can call upon it:

* From a web client as a webapp
* From a command-line terminal

Additionally, that will let us maintain a catalog of capabilities and example applications, making 
the clients require little or no update when we want to release new starter application types.

For now, we'll start with some foundational library support for the features needed, along with APIs, SPIs, 
Implementation, and a test suite. Anything to get us moving.
